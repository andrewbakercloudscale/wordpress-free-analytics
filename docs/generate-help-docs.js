    pluginDesc: 'Most WordPress analytics plugins miss 80–95% of your traffic when Cloudflare or a CDN is caching your pages. Google Analytics sends your visitor data to Google. Jetpack sends it to Automattic. CloudScale keeps every view count in your own database, counts every visit regardless of caching, and costs nothing. No subscriptions, no external services, no tracking pixels — your data stays on your server.',

<h2 style="margin:0 0 10px;font-size:1.3em;color:#0f172a;">Why CloudScale Free Analytics?</h2>
<p style="margin:0 0 10px;">If your site runs behind Cloudflare, WP Rocket, or any other caching layer, server-side analytics see only the 5–20% of requests that reach PHP. Your stats are lying to you — by a factor of 5 to 10.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10px;">CloudScale solves this with a JavaScript beacon that fires after the browser loads the page, regardless of where the HTML came from. The beacon POSTs to a REST endpoint that bypasses the CDN cache, so every real visit is counted. <strong>You finally see your actual traffic.</strong></p>
<p style="margin:0 0 10px;">Unlike Google Analytics or Jetpack, your visitor data never leaves your server. No third-party scripts, no tracking pixels, no GDPR headaches from external data processors. IP addresses are hashed before storage — the raw IP is never written to the database.</p>
<p style="margin:0;"><strong>It is completely free.</strong> No premium tier. No per-site fees. Install it, add one Cloudflare Cache Rule, and your stats are accurate from the first pageview.</p>
</div>
<p>The <strong>Statistics Dashboard</strong> shows page view data stored directly in your WordPress database across five custom tables (<code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code>, <code>wp_cspv_referrers_v2</code>, <code>wp_cspv_geo_v2</code>, <code>wp_cspv_visitors_v2</code>, <code>wp_cspv_404_v2</code>). No data is ever sent to Google, Facebook, or any external service.</p>
<p><strong>How tracking works:</strong> A lightweight <code>beacon.js</code> script fires a POST request to the WordPress REST API endpoint <code>/wp-json/cloudscale-wordpress-free-analytics/v1/record/{post_id}</code> after the page has fully loaded. Because this is a fresh HTTP request — not served from cache — it reaches WordPress even when Cloudflare or another CDN is serving the cached HTML page. This is why beacon-based tracking counts every real visit, whereas server-side counters miss 80–95% of views on cached sites.</p>
<p><strong>Cloudflare Cache Rule required for production:</strong> Add a Cache Rule in your Cloudflare dashboard: URI Path <em>contains</em> <code>/wp-json/cloudscale-wordpress-free-analytics/</code> → Cache Status: <em>Bypass</em>. Without this rule, Cloudflare may cache the REST responses, causing beacon POSTs to fail silently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Period selector</strong> — switch between Today, 7 days, 30 days, 90 days, and All time. Each period queries the <code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code> table directly; no aggregation tables are needed.</li>
<li><strong>Totals bar</strong> — Total Views, Unique Posts Viewed, and Lifetime totals pulled in a single indexed query on <code>viewed_at</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Views chart</strong> — daily bar chart. Gaps indicate days with zero traffic (not missing data).</li>
<li><strong>Top Posts table</strong> — ranked by <code>COUNT(*)</code> on <code>post_id</code> for the selected period, with direct edit links.</li>
<li><strong>Referrer breakdown</strong> — parsed from the <code>document.referrer</code> value sent by the beacon; stored in <code>wp_cspv_referrers_v2</code>. Direct traffic (no referrer) appears as "Direct".</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Privacy:</strong> visitor IP addresses are hashed with SHA-256 combined with your site's <code>wp_salt</code> before storage — the raw IP is never written to the database. The hash is used only for deduplication and throttle checks.</p>`,

        'display': `
<p>The <strong>Display Settings</strong> tab controls how view counts appear on your site and configures the sidebar widgets.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show view count on posts</strong> — appends a view counter to single post pages using the <code>the_content</code> or <code>wp_footer</code> filter. The count is read from the <code>_cspv_view_count</code> post meta key, which is synced from the <code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code> table on each beacon hit.</li>
<li><strong>View count position</strong> — before content, after content, or in post meta (appended to the post date line). The meta position requires theme support for <code>the_post_meta</code> or equivalent.</li>
<li><strong>Display style</strong> — choose between Badge (coloured pill), Pill (outlined), or Minimal (plain text) styles. Five colour options: blue, pink, red, purple, grey.</li>
<li><strong>Top Posts widget</strong> — register via <em>Appearance → Widgets</em> or block widget editor. Queries <code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code> for the configurable view window (default: all time). Settings: total posts to pool (default 10), posts per page, thumbnail width, and sort order (most viewed or most recent).</li>
<li><strong>Recent Posts widget</strong> — shows the most recently published posts with view counts. Configurable post count and optional publication date display.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude post types</strong> — comma-separated list of post types to skip tracking (e.g. <code>product</code> for WooCommerce). Excluded types do not fire the beacon and are not counted in the dashboard.</li>
</ul>`,

        'throttle': `
<p>The <strong>IP Throttle</strong> tab prevents inflated statistics from repeat page loads, bots, and your own browsing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Throttle window</strong> — the minimum gap (in minutes) between two counted views from the same hashed IP to the same post. Default: 30 minutes. The check queries <code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code> for a recent row matching <code>post_id</code> + <code>ip_hash</code> within the window. Set to 0 to count every request (not recommended for production).</li>
<li><strong>Client-side deduplication</strong> — in addition to server-side throttling, the beacon sets a <code>sessionStorage</code> key per post on first fire. If the same browser tab reloads the page, the beacon does not fire again for that session. This eliminates double-counts from accidental refreshes before the throttle window check even runs.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude logged-in users</strong> — prevents any authenticated WordPress session from being counted. Detected via the <code>logged_in_{hash}</code> cookie presence check in the beacon.</li>
<li><strong>Exclude administrators</strong> — more granular: only users with the <code>administrator</code> role are excluded. Editors, Authors, and Contributors are still counted.</li>
<li><strong>Pause tracking</strong> — sets the <code>cspv_tracking_paused</code> WordPress option to <code>1</code>. The REST endpoint returns a 200 OK but writes no rows. Use during content imports, load tests, or bulk migrations to avoid polluting your stats.</li>
<li><strong>Fail2Ban / IP blocklist</strong> — IPs exceeding the configurable per-window page limit are permanently blocked. Blocked IPs are stored in the <code>cspv_ftb_blocklist</code> option and checked at the top of the REST handler before any database write.</li>
</ul>`,

        'history': `
<p>The <strong>Post History</strong> tab provides a full day-by-day breakdown of views for any individual post or page — useful for diagnosing traffic spikes, measuring the impact of promotions, and spotting seasonal patterns.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Post search</strong> — autocomplete dropdown queries <code>wp_posts</code> by title. Supports pages, custom post types, and any post type that has tracking enabled.</li>
<li><strong>View timeline</strong> — bar chart showing daily view volume from the post's first recorded view to the current date. Built from a <code>GROUP BY DATE(viewed_at)</code> query on <code>wp_cspv_views_v2</code> filtered to the selected <code>post_id</code>. Days with zero views are filled in programmatically so the chart has no gaps.</li>
<li><strong>Total views</strong> — lifetime count for that post. This is the same value stored in the <code>_cspv_view_count</code> post meta key, which you can query directly: <code>get_post_meta($post_id, '_cspv_view_count', true)</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Trending indicator</strong> — compares the last 7 days of views against the 28-day average daily rate for that post. Green arrow = accelerating; red arrow = decelerating. Posts with fewer than 7 days of data show "Insufficient history".</li>
<li><strong>Jetpack migration</strong> — if you migrated from Jetpack Stats, the lifetime view count imported during migration is stored as a base offset and blended with live beacon data. The Post History chart shows both the imported baseline and new beacon views combined.</li>
</ul>`,
